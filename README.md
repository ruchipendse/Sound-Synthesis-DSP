# Sound-Synthesis-DSP
In this project, we will be synthesizing sound by using the Karplus Strong algorithm with a simple push-button interface.
As a starting point to understanding the implementation of the algorithm in Python, we looked through repositories https://github.com/joetechem/frequency_overtones_python and https://github.com/joetechem/frequency_overtones_python.git.
Moreover, academic references of the research paper as well as implementation guidelines by different institutes were also utilised:
